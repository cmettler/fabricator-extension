# Runs a TIER of suites, and fails loudly unless every selected suite actually ran.
#
#   run-suites.sh hermetic   (default) needs nothing but a scratch dir and the in-repo fixtures
#   run-suites.sh service              needs the docker/docker-compose.yml stack: SQL Server + MinIO
#
# One runner for both so the assertions below — the part with the actual value — exist once. Used by
# CI and usable as-is on a dev machine.
#
# ONE PROCESS PER SUITE, with a FRESH scratch directory each. Both halves are load-bearing, and
# were established by watching the alternative fail:
#
#   * Batching the whole set into one `unittest -f <list>` invocation SIGSEGVs partway through
#     (observed at suite 41/53, in Apache.Arrow's ImportedArrowArrayStream finalizer during
#     GC.RunFinalizers) and reports spurious failures. One CLR is booted for the process, so state
#     and finalizers from earlier suites outlive them and run during later ones. Every suite passes
#     in isolation.
#   * Sharing one scratch directory across suites makes them collide on table paths; CLAUDE.md's
#     documented recipe gives each file its own.
#
# The per-suite cost is a CLR boot (~1-2s), which is the price of isolation.
#
# ASSERTIONS THIS MAKES, beyond a zero exit status — none of which `unittest` gives you for free:
#   * every selected suite reports "All tests passed"
#   * NOTHING skips. A skip here means an environment variable CI thought it set is missing, or a
#     `require`d extension is not linked; either way the suite silently tested nothing.
#   * the runner never says "No tests ran". A filter that matches no test case exits ZERO, so a
#     mistyped suite path would otherwise be a permanently green no-op.
#
# Environment:
#   UNITTEST   path to the unittest binary   (default: build/release/test/unittest[.exe])
#   MANAGED    path to the published bridge  (default: build/release/extension/fabricator/fabricator)
